## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

<b>KaroDilseVote</b> is a Secure, Transparent, Auditable and Reliable voting system where user can vote freely by building trust in the voting system.

In the existing voting system, we face various problems like identity theft and lack of participation from citizens in voting.  

KaroDilseVote will solve this problem by enabling voters to verify whether their casted votes are recorded and counted

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Objective

People donâ€™t come to voting as they lack trust in the current government voting system

The current system lacks transparency and there are cases of theft and tampering with the votes casted by the people

Due to this issue people donâ€™t feel like going to vote hence the percentage of people voting are very less.

## ðŸ“Œ Proposed Idea

As an authenticated admin, I can keep my voting polls and come back later to access them.
As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.
As an authenticated admin, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.
As an authenticated admin, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.
As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of poll
As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This will be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)
As an authenticated admin, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.
People voting through KarodilseVote will be given exclusive offers, coupon codes and discount with the patnerd companies which will attract the people to cast votes
